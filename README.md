This library adds a custom report to [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/) (phpcs) to generate a codequality artifact that can be used by GitLab CI/CD.
The custom report is generated in Code Climate format and allows GitLab CI/CD to display the violations in the Code Quality report.

## Installation

Install this library using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```shell script
composer require --dev micheh/phpcs-gitlab
```

Then adjust your `.gitlab-ci.yml` to run PHP_CodeSniffer with the custom reporter and to collect the codequality artifacts:

```yaml
phpcs:
  script: vendor/bin/phpcs --report=full --report-\\Micheh\\PhpCodeSniffer\\Report\\Gitlab=phpcs-quality-report.json
  artifacts:
    reports:
      codequality: phpcs-quality-report.json
```

The example above uses two reports, one to display in the build log (full) and one to generate the codequality artifact file in Code Climate format.

> **Note:** GitLab did not support multiple codequality artifacts before version 15.7. 
> If you are using an earlier version of GitLab, you will not be able to see the violations from multiple tools (e.g. PHP Code Sniffer & PHPStan) in the Code Quality report.

Inside the codequality artifact, GitLab expects relative paths to the files with violations. 
To generate relative paths with PHP Code Sniffer, set the `basepath` argument in your `phpcs.xml.dist` configuration file with `<arg name="basepath" value="."/>` or run phpcs with `--basepath=.` (adjust the base path as needed).

It is also possible to specify the reports to be used in the `phpcs.xml.dist` file:

```xml
<arg name="report" value="full"/>
<arg name="report-\Micheh\PhpCodeSniffer\Report\Gitlab" value="phpcs-quality-report.json"/>
```
